    <p><strong>Product Owner – Documentation, Platforms, and Delivery Readiness</strong></p>

    <p>
      I work at the intersection of product ownership, technical documentation,
      and delivery execution. My focus is reducing delivery risk, accelerating
      adoption, and making complex systems usable in regulated, enterprise environments.
    </p>

    <h2>What I Do</h2>

<ul>
  <li>Own and prioritize backlogs across ambiguous, cross-functional initiatives</li>
  <li>Translate business, compliance, and technical requirements into executable delivery plans</li>
  <li>Design documentation and knowledge systems that scale and survive audits</li>
  <li>Partner with engineering, operations, and leadership to remove delivery friction</li>
  <li>Support end-to-end SDLC execution from discovery through release and adoption</li>
</ul>

<h2>Case Studies</h2>

<h3>Stabilizing Enterprise Knowledge Systems in a Regulated Environment</h3>

<p><strong>Context</strong><br>
A large organization maintained hundreds of fragmented knowledge artifacts across teams, creating inconsistent guidance, operational risk, and poor searchability.</p>

<p><strong>Problem</strong><br>
Documentation debt slowed delivery, increased support escalations, and introduced compliance risk due to outdated or conflicting content.</p>

<p><strong>My Role</strong><br>
Product Owner responsible for documentation strategy, backlog prioritization, stakeholder alignment, and delivery readiness.</p>

<p><strong>Actions</strong></p>
<ul>
  <li>Audited and rationalized existing knowledge assets across multiple departments</li>
  <li>Defined standardized article structures and governance rules</li>
  <li>Prioritized remediation work aligned to operational risk</li>
  <li>Partnered with engineering and business teams to align content with system behavior</li>
  <li>Established review and maintenance workflows to prevent regression</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Outcome</strong><br>
Improved consistency, searchability, and reduced operational and compliance risk.</p>
